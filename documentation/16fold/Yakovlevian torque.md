### Handedness

A 2012 literature review showed that [morphometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics "Morphometrics") studies had consistently found that [handedness-related](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness "Handedness") effects corresponded to the extent of the Yakovlevian Torque;[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakovlevian_torque#cite_note-Renteria-5) increased torque, as measured by increased size of the right-frontal petalia and the left-occipital petalia, tends to be more common in right-handed individuals.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakovlevian_torque#cite_note-Phillips-6) Individuals with mixed-handedness or left-handedness show reduced levels of Yakovlevian torque.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakovlevian_torque#cite_note-7)

### Developmental stuttering

Reduced right-frontal and left-occipital petalias and reversed petalia asymmetries (that is, left-frontal and right occipital petalias) have been associated with developmental [stuttering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttering "Stuttering") in both adults and pre-adolescent boys.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakovlevian_torque#cite_note-Mock-2) This may be tied to the [lateral sulcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_sulcus "Lateral sulcus") housing [Broca's area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%27s_area "Broca's area"),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakovlevian_torque#cite_note-Renteria-5) which plays a significant role in [production of language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech "Speech").

### [[bipolaridad]]

Increased size of the left-occipital petalia, resulting from an abnormally high degree of Yakovlevian torque has been associated with [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder "Bipolar disorder").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakovlevian_torque#cite_note-Maller-1) Maller et al. 2015 found that increased asymmetry of the occipital lobe, or occipital bending, was four times more prevalent in subjects with bipolar disorder than in healthy controls.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakovlevian_torque#cite_note-Maller-1) This applied both to patients with [bipolar disorder type I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_I_disorder "Bipolar I disorder") and [type II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_II_disorder "Bipolar II disorder").
